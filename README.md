This README.md files is the DDD(Design Detailed Document) for the project of creating a website.

**DESCRIPTION OF MY WORK:**

This project consists in developing a website, to document and record everthing that has I have learned in the subjects of the degree which I am currently coursing. (Computer Science)

To make this posible my webpage will include the following sections:

A main section, showing information about the website

A conctact section, including a contact form

A net section, showing information about the websites of my partners and also their links.

An about me section, showing a small introduction about myself, including 2 images, a CV and some links to Social Media.

A course section, showing the academic program with the different subjects grouped by courses. Including a detail subsection including the subject of Fundamentals of Computer Science.

A CSS folder, storing all css files.

A public folder, will store all of the individual section's .html files

An Images folder, will store all of the images used in the development of this project.

**PROBLEMS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT**

Problem 1: During the development of the home page (index.html) I faced a problem which consisted in applying the CSS and images on to the HTML file which were in another folder. At the beggining I thougnt that this was a problem with the GitHub repository and this made me deleted and create another repositoy and start everything from the top. At the end I concluded that it was a simple issue that only took 10 seconds to finally fix it. 

Problem 2: During the development of the Contact Page and the Degree Page it was quite difficult to add the correct styles to each of the classes for example the list of the contact form so it could when it was visualised in the website it was clear and friendly to users to read and see the content. 

Problem 3: During the development of the Net page, small problem occured on the font of the menu where the links to the other websites are located. This was a bit weird since the same CSS style and code was used over and over again of the previous sections and the font did not change at any point. But on the Net Page it changed to another font using the same CSS code, so I investigated to find what was the original font used in the other pages. The result was that the font used was called "Poppins", so I decided to manually fix the problem by adding "font-family: Poppins;" in the appropiate part of the code and the issue was solved. This also happened for the copyright section of the page, at the end this code was used in the CSS file "font-family: Montserrat;". For the future I will use this fragments to avoid any problems further on.
